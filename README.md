# NodeJs Realtime Chat Application

This sample application was done to learn and understand **NodeJs**. To build this application, **socket.io** and **mongodb** was utilised. 

**Socket.IO** was used due to make use of the real time capabilities to publish messages.
**MongoDB** was used to store the messages that are entered. This also enables a new user to see the last couple of messages.

For the UI, **Bootstrap** was used and contains a very minimalistic UI as the main aim was to understand and learn NodeJS.

Finally **Microsoft Azure** was utilised to host the application and the database.
